Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

	I believe that all requirements for the assignment have been implemented successfully and properly, with the exception of: "Upon clicking on a MBTA Red Line subway station marker, display an infowindow of the schedule of upcoming trains for that station"

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

	I received guidance from Yotam Bentov, one of the COMP11 TAs. I also received guidance from two Stack Overflow articles (see below):

	(1) Concerning Calulating the Distance Between Two Geopoints via Haversine Formula

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

	I spent approximately 12 hours completing this lab.
