What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this Git repository is to contain all of my coursework from COMP20, a Web Programming course at Tufts University. I took this course during the Fall 2016 semester.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment from this class was the Semester Group Project because it afforded me greater ownership and autonomy over my learning than the other labs and assignments. I also enjoyed the teamwork aspect of this project.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

A lot, but not as much as I hoped at the start. But at least I now have a solid base from which to continue to learn and grow as a web programmer.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The two most important things I learned in this course were: (1) how to better read documentation and (2) how to create more modular code. The MBTA assignment was a major breakthrough for me in my ability to read, understand, and implement insights from online documentation. And a teammate on my Semester Group Project, Nathan Watts, taught me how to better modularize my code using: "<% include ../partials/file_name.ejs %>" 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Back-end coding! I still struggle with this!!!
