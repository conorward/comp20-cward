	<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p>I was hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues present in Jialu Wei's Assignment 3 (<a href="https://peaceful-reaches-82103.herokuapp.com/">link to server</a>), which is a modification of the popular game, 2048.</p>

	<h1>Methodology</h1>

	<p>
	Initially I used curl command line injections to insert data into Jialu's database (i.e. a process of "black box" testing). To begin with, I simply inserted a new highest score (username=shaboyberries) and a new lowest score (username=me) score into the leaderboard by making POST requests. Then I tried running some scripts and deploying HTML forms, however I was unsuccessful. Finally I looked through Jialu's code to further analyze the presence of vulnerabilities and to try to pinpoint their locations.

	Here is an example of a script injection I tried:

	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>

	<p>
	I found 3 security issues with Jialu's 2048 application:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Rate Limiting</li>
		<li>SQL Injections</li>
		<li>Cross-Origin Resource-Sharing</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Issues Found</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Rate Limiting, as I can make as many GET requests on her server as I like. Granted, there isn't any sensitive data currently stored in the database, however this vulnerability can still be a major issue with databases holding more sensitive data. Without a rate limit, hackers can try an unlimited number of credentials, thus enhancing their chances of submitting a recognized set of credentials and gaining access to the server's data.</li>
		<li>SQL Injections, as I was able to create and read data stored in the back-end database using curl. SQL Injections allow hackers to perform many malicious acts, including data tampering, acquisition of all data in a given database, and even data destruction.</li>
		<li>Cross-Origin Resource-Sharing</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

	<p>
	In conclusion, there are several problematic security vulnerabilities present in Jialu's application. The first, its lack of rate limiting, would be much more worrisome if this was an app that stored sensitive personal data, since rate limiting is a primary defense against private account hacking.

<!-- 
Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do
Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location / page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
Proof of vulnerability. Show pictures.
Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.
Conclusion - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.
